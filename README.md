# Genie Fusion

Genie Fusion is a software development kit (SDK) for the Genie engine.
It upholds consistent standards towards modding the Genie engine.
This consists of [JSON serialization](#json-schemas), [LUA scripting](#lua-api), and [prototypes](#prototypes).

## JSON Schemas

Genie Fusion uses JSON schemas to validate Genie engine files, thus standardising their format and structures.

### Supported Files

 - Hot-Key (HKI)
 - Dynamic-Resources (DRS).
 - Databases (DAT) (including Blendomatic and others).
 - Scenarios (SCN).
 - Spectacles (GAM, MGS).
 - Random-Map Scripts (RMS).
 - Personality Scripts (PER).

## LUA API

Genie Fusion is bundled with a LUA interface of the engine. See [Genie Luna](Genie-Luna) for more information.

## Prototypes

Genie Fusion also contains prototypes to standardise the known builds of the Genie engine along with all their assets.
