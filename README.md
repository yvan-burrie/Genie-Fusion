# Genie Fusion

Genie Fusion is a software development kit (SDK) for the Genie engine.
It upholds consistent standards towards modding the Genie engine.
This consists of [JSON serialization](#json-schemas), [LUA scripting](#lua-api), and [prototypes](#prototypes).

## JSON Schemas
Genie Fusion uses JSON schemas to validate Genie engine files, thus standardising their format and structures.

## LUA API
Genie Fusion is bundled with a LUA interface of the engine. See [Genie Luna](Genie-Luna) for more information.

## Prototypes
Genie Fusion also contains prototypes to standardise the known builds of the Genie engine along with all their assets.
